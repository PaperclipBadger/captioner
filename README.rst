captioner
=========

This is a very simple app for collecting plaintext image captions.
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Instructions
------------

1. `poetry install`
2. Put images that need captions in `captioner/static/images`
3. Run `python -m captioner.initdb`
4. Run `python -m captioner`

The web interface should be self-explanatory.
